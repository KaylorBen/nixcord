# Nixcord

Manage [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord) settings and plugins
declaratively with Nix!

This repo can be used to make a clean looking config for Vencord without needing
to pollute system config with needless utils to override the discord pacakge,
and write ugly JSON code directly in .nix files.

I started this project after having to reinstall my NixOS system several times,
resulting in manually enabling and configuring the ~100 Vencord plugins more
than 4 times. With Nixcord you can configure once and save it to a git repo.

>[!WARNING]
> Using Nixcord means comitting to declaratively installing plugins. This means
> that the normal "plugins" menu in Vencord will not apply permenant changes.
> You can still use it to test out plugins but on restarting the client, any
> changes will be gone.
>
> The primary goal of this project is to reduce the need to configure Vencord
> again on every new system you install.

## How to use Nixcord

Currently Nixcord only supports nix flakes as a
[home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) module.

First, you need to import the module:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  # ...
  inputs.nixcord = {
    url = "github:kaylorben/nixcord";
  };
  # ...
}
```

Next you'll have to import the home-manager module into flake.nix. This step
varies depending on how you have home-manager installed. Here is a simple
example of home-manager installed as a nixos module:

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  # ...
  outputs = inputs@{ nixpkgs, home-manager, ... }: {
    nixosConfigurations = {
      hostname = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
        modules = [
          ./configuration.nix
          home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
          {
            home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true;
            home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
            home-manager.users.jdoe = import ./home.nix;

            home-manager.sharedModules = [
              inputs.nixcord.homeModules.nixcord
            ];
          }
        ];
      };
    };
  };
  # ...
}
```

or to install to a specific home

```nix
# home.nix
{
  # ...
  imports = [
    inputs.nixcord.homeModules.nixcord
  ];
  # ...
}
```

After installation, you can easily start editing config

## Configuration

This is an example home-manager configuration using Nixcord

```nix
# home.nix
{
  # ...
  programs.nixcord = {
    enable = true;          # Enable Nixcord (It also installs Discord)
    vesktop.enable = true;  # Vesktop
    dorion.enable = true;   # Dorion
    quickCss = "some CSS";  # quickCSS file
    config = {
      useQuickCss = true;   # use out quickCSS
      themeLinks = [        # or use an online theme
        "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/link/to/some/theme.css"
      ];
      frameless = true;                   # Set some Vencord options
      plugins = {
        hideAttachments.enable = true;    # Enable a Vencord plugin
        ignoreActivities = {              # Enable a plugin and set some options
          enable = true;
          ignorePlaying = true;
          ignoreWatching = true;
          ignoredActivities = [ "someActivity" ];
        };
      };
    };
    dorion = {
      theme = "dark";
      zoom = "1.1";
      blur = "acrylic";       # "none", "blur", or "acrylic"
      sysTray = true;
      openOnStartup = true;
      autoClearCache = true;
      disableHardwareAccel = false;
      rpcServer = true;
      rpcProcessScanner = true;
      pushToTalk = true;
      pushToTalkKeys = ["RControl"];
      desktopNotifications = true;
      unreadBadge = true;
    };
    extraConfig = {
      # Some extra JSON config here
      # ...
    };
  };
  # ...
}
```

### Dorion Setup Requirements

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before enabling Dorion with nixcord, you must first launch Dorion once to
> create the necessary LocalStorage databases for Vencord settings

1. **Initial setup**: Run Dorion temporarily to set up the initial environment:
```bash
# Using nix run
nix run github:KaylorBen/nixcord#dorion

# Or using legacy nix-build
nix-build https://github.com/KaylorBen/nixcord/archive/main.tar.gz -A dorion
```

2. **Login**: In Dorion, log into your Discord account, then close Dorion
completely.

3. **Configure and rebuild**: Now enable Dorion in your Home Manager
configuration and rebuild

This step is required because nixcord automatically configures Vencord settings
in Dorion's LocalStorage database, but these databases only exist after the
first launch and login

It is highly recommend configuring Nixcord with an open Vencord client to
look through available plugins and options. A list of all available options is
available [here](docs/INDEX.md).

## Special Thanks

Special Thanks to [Vencord](https://github.com/Vendicated/Vencord),
[Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager), and
[Nix](https://nixos.org/) and all the contributers behind them. Without them,
this project would not be possible.

## Disclaimer

Using Vencord violates Discord's terms of service.
